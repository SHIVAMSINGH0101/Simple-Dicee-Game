# Simple-Dicee-Game
This is simple Dice game that I created when I started learning javascript. This program generates two random numbers between 1 and 6 shows them on two Dices for two players each time website is reloaded, it shows the winner on screen. This is a very basic dice game created from scratch by using HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
